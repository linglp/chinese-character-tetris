# 🎮 Chinese Character Tetris (汉字俄罗斯方块)

A fun and educational twist on the classic Tetris game that teaches Chinese vocabulary through gameplay! Instead of colored blocks, pieces are made of Chinese characters. When you complete a row containing valid Chinese words or phrases, you earn points and collect "food items" - traditional Chinese desserts and snacks!
